Read image
Convert image to grayscale
First, let's create a new directory named image_editor and add an empty file __init__.py to make it a Python package.

Now, let's create a new Python file convert_to_grayscale.py inside the image_editor directory with the following content:

python
Edit
Full Screen
Copy code
import cv2

def convert_to_grayscale(image):
    return cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
Here, we have defined a function convert_to_grayscale that takes an image as input and converts it to grayscale using OpenCV.

Next, let's create another Python file read_image.py inside the image_editor directory with the following content:

python
Edit
Full Screen
Copy code
import cv2
import image_editor.convert_to_grayscale as cvt

def read_image(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    if image is None:
        raise Exception("Unable to open image file")
    return cvt.convert_to_grayscale(image)
Here, we have defined a function read_image that takes an image path as input, reads the image using OpenCV, and converts it to grayscale using the convert_to_grayscale function defined earlier.

Now, let's test our package by creating a new Python file test_image_editor.py outside the image_editor directory with the following content:

python
Edit
Full Screen
Copy code
import image_editor.read_image as ri

if __name__ == '__main__':
    image = ri.read_image("tesla.png")
    ri.show_image(image)
Here, we have imported the read_image function from the image_editor package and used it toread an image file tesla.png and display it using OpenCV's show_image function.

To create a Python package, we need to create a setup.py file outside the image_editor directory with the following content:

python
Edit
Full Screen
Copy code
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name='image_editor',
    version='0.1',
    packages=find_packages(),
    install_requires=['opencv-python-headless']
)
Here, we have specified the package name, version, and dependencies (in this case, OpenCV).

Finally, we can create a distribution package using the following command:

Edit
Full Screen
Copy code
python setup.py sdist
This will create a dist directory containing the distribution package image_editor-0.1.tar.gz.

To install the package, we can use the following command:

Edit
Full Screen
Copy code
pip install image_editor-0.1.tar.gz
That's it! We have created a Python package for image processing using OpenCV. Of course, this is just a simple example, and there are many more functionalities that can be added to the package.# Ai-image
